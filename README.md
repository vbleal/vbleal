Bringing several years of seasoned expertise in the Banking industry, I am a Data Scientist and Financial Risk Manager with a track record of leading teams across Mexico and Latin America, as well as working remotely with teams in the USA and Spain. My journey includes some years of international consultancy for financial groups, specializing in Financial Risks and Chief Data Office initiatives.

My core competencies lie in data analytics, data modeling, and the development of sophisticated credit risk models (both retail and wholesale), liquidity risk models, and capital risk models. I have substantial experience in regulatory reporting for the banking sector, adhering to regulations in Mexico and Europe, and have frequently engaged with regulators.

I thrive in presenting to Boards of Directors and internal committees, underlining my ability to translate complex data insights into strategic decisions. My collaborative projects with business units exemplify my commitment to integrating data-driven solutions across organizational facets.

Passionate about the evolving landscape of Generative Artificial Intelligence, I am a lifelong learner, constantly enhancing my knowledge. My educational background includes a degree in Physics and Mathematics, a Master's in Finance, a Master's in Big Data & Data Science, and I am currently specializing in Artificial Intelligence.

As a Director-level expert, my goal is to lead enterprises into the data era, leveraging my deep understanding of machine learning and AI to drive innovation and growth.
